	    		<h1>About SafeFace</h1>
	    		<p>
	    			SafeFace is a bias recognition application used to detect implicit social cognition or bias to

ethnicity, gender, age, weight, sexuality and religion. Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or 

stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. 

These biases are activated involuntarily and without an individual’s awareness or intentional 

control, making SafeFace the ideal bias detector.
	    		</p>
	    		
	    		<p>
	    			The implicit associations we harbor in our subconscious cause us to have feelings and attitudes 

about other people based on social characteristics.  These associations develop over the course of 

a lifetime beginning at a very early age through exposure to direct and indirect messages.  In 

addition to early life experiences, the media and news programming are often-cited origins of 

implicit associations.
	    		</p>
	    		
	    		<p>
	    			SafeFace was founded in May 2015 by five tech girls at the eMerge Hackathon.  The goal of this 

application is to educate the public about implicit social cognition and to provide a virtual 

implicit association test (IAT) to measure attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or 

unable to report. Your SafeFace score will show any implicit attitude that you did not know 

about.

    			<h2>What is implicit bias?</h2>
    			<p>
    				An implicit bias is a positive or negative mental attitude towards a person, thing, or group that a 

person holds at an unconscious level. In contrast, an explicit bias is an attitude that somebody is 

consciously aware of having. Research has found that our implicit and explicit biases often 

diverge. For example, a person may consciously express a neutral or positive opinion about a 

social group that they unconsciously hold a negative opinion about.
    			</p>
    			
    			<h2>How common are implicit biases?</h2>
    			<p>
    				Since 1998, over 4.5 million people have taken the Implicit Association Test (IAT) online. This 

data strongly suggests that many people hold implicit biases towards members of particular 

groups. For example, over 80% of people who completed an IAT on age bias demonstrated a 

negative implicit bias against the elderly. In addition, about 75% of Whites and Asians 

demonstrated an implicit bias in favor of Whites compared to Blacks.
    			</p>
    			
    			
    			<h2>Why do implicit biases matter?</h2>
    			<p>
    				Over 200 published studies using the IAT have shown that implicit bias can influence behavior 

in important ways. For example, IAT scores can predict how we treat members of another race, 

whether we are likely to binge drink, and even whether we are likely to attempt suicide. In 

addition, several studies have shown that implicit biases can significantly affect the way people 

evaluate job candidates. We believe that by becoming more aware of implicit bias and how it can 

influence decisions, people may be able to limit the influence that implicit bias has on their own 

behavior.

    			<h2>How does SafeFace measure implicit attitudes?</h2>
    			<p>
    				SafeFace takes snippets of facial expression………………..  The images are ……and records a 

user’s positive or negative bias toward a social cognition.
    			</p>
    			
    			
    			<h2>What does it mean if I get a SafeFace score that I don't believe describes me or, if I take the

same test twice, I get different results each time.</h2>
    			<p>
    				These tests are not perfectly accurate by any definition of accuracy. Normally, outcomes will

change at least slightly from one taking to another. You may discover this if you repeat any of 

the tests. We encourage repeating any test for which the outcome surprises you. If the outcome 

repeats, the result is definitely more trustworthy than is the first result alone. If the outcome 

varies, it is best to average the different results. However, if the outcome varies widely from one 

taking to another (something that is unusual) we suggest that you just regard the set of results as 

'inconclusive'. Besides normal variation in the reliability of assessment, the IAT is also known to 

be malleable based on differences in the social setting and recent experience. These factors will 

influence the consistency of measurement across occasions.
    			</p>
    			
    			
    			<h2>What does it mean that my SafeFace score is labeled 'slight', 'moderate', or 'strong'?</h2>
    			<p>
    				Assume that you respond faster when flower pictures and pleasant words are paired on a single 

key than when insect pictures and pleasant words are paired on a single key. Your score would 

be described as showing automatic preference for flowers. (In general, a result shows an 

association between concepts that, when paired, get fast responding.) The labels 'slight,' 

'moderate,' and 'strong' refer to the strength of the association (i.e. how strongly you associate 

flower pictures with pleasant words). No matter which IAT you took, if a speed difference 

between different pairings was so great as to be obvious to you, it would likely be labeled a 

'strong' effect. The 'moderate' label also indicates a difference large enough so that you would 

probably notice it. A 'slight' effect is one that is noticeable in statistical analysis, but you may not 

have been aware of it.
    			</p>
    			
    			<h2>My feedback was that 'there were too many errors to determine a result.' Does this mean I 

have no automatic preference or association?</h2>
    			<p>The test requires a certain number of correct responses in order to generate an interpretable 

result. If your feedback was that 'there were too many errors to determine a result,' then the data 

produced in your test were ones that cannot be interpreted confidently with regard to automatic 

associations. This is different from a result that shows little or no association, which will be 

reported to you as 'little to no' automatic preference/association.</p>
